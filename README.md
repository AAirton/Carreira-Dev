## Repository Summary

This repository, `Carreira-Dev`, is a personal collection of studies and problem-solving exercises, primarily focused on Python programming. It is structured to track progress through different learning phases and practice platforms.

### Structure:

*   **`Estudos/`**: Contains subdirectories organized by week (e.g., `Semana-0`, `Semana-1`), holding notes, small exercises (e.g., `Exercicios_input.py`, `Problema-1.py`), and project files (e.g., `Sabor-Express/app.py`). This section is dedicated to structured learning.
*   **`Problemas/Beecrowd/`**: Houses solutions to programming challenges from the Beecrowd platform, with files named after their respective problem IDs (e.g., `1000.py`, `1001.py`). This section focuses on practical problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.

This setup indicates a comprehensive approach to software development education, combining theoretical studies with hands-on coding challenges.
